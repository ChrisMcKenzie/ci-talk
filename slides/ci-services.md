https://travis-ci.org/ <br/>
https://drone.io/ <br/>
https://jenkins-ci.org/ <br/>
https://circleci.com/ <br/>
And a ton more!

Note:
these are some of the services that offer Ci and they each provide slightly
different interfaces but they all have a few things in common.

- All of them can recieve webhooks from various SCM services
- All of them require you to write some sort of script to tell the service
what you want to do.
- All of them can inform different communication channels if a failure has occured

But the one we are going to talk about is wercker.
